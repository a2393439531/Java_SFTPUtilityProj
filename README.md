Java SFTP Apache commons file download, upload and delete example 


Secure File Transfer Protocol or SFTP uses the SSH secure shell protocol to provides file access, file transfer, and file management functionalities over any reliable data stream. Apache Commons VFS provides a single API for accessing various different file systems and one of them is SFTP. Here I have uploaded examples for how to use the VFS to achieve file download, upload and delete on a remote system.
